// create a constant variable (const)

// create three variables and assign them values of different data types (=)
let gee = "sleep"; //string
let age = 5; //number
let pretty = true //boolean

// print the types of two variables that reference two different data types (typeof)
// TIP: console.log() prints a value in the console/terminal
console.log(typeof pretty);


// change the value referenced by a variable (dynamic typing)
let variable1 = false;

// print the type of the variable you just changed (typeof)

// create variables and give them values to complete the sentences that will print

// ? what type of data needs to go in each variable?
